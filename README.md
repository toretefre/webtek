Web site made for "Gravbergets Venner" as a group project for the subject IT2805 Web Technologies at NTNU Gl√∏shaugen, Trondheim, Norway.

The group was not allowed to use frameworks, and the site is therefore written in vanilla HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

The project is published at <a href="https://org.ntnu.no/gravberget">org.ntnu.no/gravberget</a>, but it is currently not being maintained.
